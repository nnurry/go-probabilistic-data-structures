# PROBABILISTICS

This repository is a compilation of flexible probabilistic data structures and algorithms, based on popular implementations. It leaves users with choices to replace hash functions, and extend its functionalities. 

Another version of [my old PDSA repository](https://github.com/nnurry/pds-old).
